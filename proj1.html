</p><p>The objective of this project is to practice and assess your
understanding of functional programming and Haskell. You will write code to
implement the guessing part of a logical guessing game.</p><!--TOC section id="sec1" The Game of <span style="font-family:sans-serif">ChordProbe</span> -->
<h2 id="sec1" class="section">The Game of <span style="font-family:sans-serif">ChordProbe</span></h2><!--SEC END --><p><span style="font-family:sans-serif">ChordProbe</span>  is a two-player logical guessing game created for this
project. You will not find any information about the game anywhere
else, but it is a simple game and this specification will tell you all you
need to know.</p><p>For a <span style="font-family:sans-serif">ChordProbe</span> game, one player will be the <em>composer</em> and the
other is the <em>performer</em>. The composer begins by selecting a
three-pitch musical chord, where each pitch comprises a musical
<em>note</em>, one of <span style="font-style:italic">A, B, C, D, E, F,</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">G</span>, and an
<em>octave</em>, one of <span style="font-style:italic">1, 2,</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">3</span>. This chord will
be the <em>target</em> for the game. The order of pitches in the target
is irrelevant, and no pitch may appear more than once. This game does
not include sharps or flats, and no more or less than three notes may
be included in the target.</p><p>Once the composer has selected the target chord, the performer
repeatedly chooses a similarly defined chord as a <em>guess</em> and tells it
to the composer, who responds by giving the performer the following
<em>feedback</em>:
</p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
how many pitches in the guess are included in the target
(correct pitches)
</li><li class="li-enumerate">how many pitches have the right note but the wrong octave
(correct notes)
</li><li class="li-enumerate">how many pitches have the right octave but the wrong note (correct
octaves)
</li></ol><p>
In counting correct notes and octaves, multiple occurrences in the guess
are only counted as correct if they also appear repeatedly in the
target.
Correct pitches are not also counted as correct notes and octaves.
For example, with a target of <em>A1, B2, A3</em>, a guess of
<em>A1, A2, B1</em> would be counted as 1 correct pitch (<em>A1</em>), two
correct notes (<em>A2, B1</em>) and one correct octave (<em>A2</em>).
<em>B1</em> would not be counted as a correct octave, even though it has
the same octave as the target <em>A1</em>, because the target <em>A1</em>
was already used to count the guess <em>A1</em> as a correct pitch.

</table>
</div><p>The game finishes once the performer guesses the correct chord (all
three pitches in the guess are in the target). The object of the game
for the performer is to find the target with the fewest possible guesses.</p><!--TOC section id="sec2" The Program-->
<h2 id="sec2" class="section">The Program</h2><!--SEC END --><p>
You will write Haskell code to implement the <em>performer</em> part of
the game. This will require you to write a function to return your
initial guess, and another to use the feedback from the previous guess
to determine the next guess. The latter function will be called
repeatedly until it produces the correct guess. You will find it
useful to keep information between guesses; since Haskell is a purely
functional language, you cannot use a global or static variable to
store this. Therefore, your initial guess function must return this
game state information, and your next guess function must take the
game state as input and return the updated game state as output. You
may put any information you like in the game state, but you
<span style="font-style:italic">must</span> define a type <span style="font-family:monospace">GameState</span> to hold this
information. If you do not need to maintain any game state, you may
simply define <span style="font-family:monospace">type GameState = ()</span>.</p><p>You may use any representation you like for notes, octaves, pitches,
and chords internally, and may use this representation inside your
<span style="font-family:monospace">GameState</span> type. However, to avoid prejudicing your choice of
representations, we use a very simple representation for the inputs
and outputs of your functions. A chord is represented as a list of
two-character strings, where the first character is an upper case
letter between <span style="font-family:monospace">&#X2019;A&#X2019;</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace">&#X2019;G&#X2019;</span> representing the note,
and the second is a digit character between <span style="font-family:monospace">&#X2019;1&#X2019;</span> and
<span style="font-family:monospace">&#X2019;3&#X2019;</span> representing the octave.</p><p>You must define following functions:
</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">initialGuess :: ([String],GameState)</span></dt><dd class="dd-description">  <br>
 takes no input arguments, and returns a pair of an initial guess
and a game state.
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">nextGuess :: ([String],GameState) </span>&#X2192;<span style="font-weight:bold"> (Int,Int,Int)
</span>&#X2192;<span style="font-weight:bold"> ([String],GameState)</span></dt><dd class="dd-description">  <br>
 takes as input a pair of the previous guess and game state, and
the feedback to this guess as a triple of correct pitches, notes,
and octaves, and returns a pair of the next guess and game state.
</dd></dl><p>You must call your (main) source file <span style="font-family:monospace">Proj1.hs</span> (or
<span style="font-family:monospace">Proj1.lhs</span> if you use literate Haskell),
and it must contain the module declaration:
</p><pre>
    module Proj1 (initialGuess, nextGuess, GameState) where
</pre><p>
You may divide your code into as many files as you like, as long as
your main file (and the files it imports) imports all the others. But
do not feel you need to divide your program into many files if it is
reasonably small.</p><p>I will post a test driver program <span style="font-family:monospace">Proj1Test.hs</span>,
which will operate similarly to how I actually test
your code. I will compile
and link your code for testing using the command:
</p><pre>
    ghc -O2 --make Proj1Test
</pre><p>
or similar.
To run <span style="font-family:monospace">Proj1Test</span>, give it the target as three separate
command line arguments, for example <span style="font-family:monospace">./Proj1Test D1 B1 G2</span>
would search for the target <span style="font-family:monospace">["D1", "B1", "G2"]</span>.
It will then use your <span style="font-family:monospace">Proj1</span> module to
guess the target; the output will look something like:
</p><pre class="verbatim">Your guess 1:  ["A1","B1","C2"]
My answer:  (1,0,2)
Your guess 2:  ["A1","D1","E2"]
My answer:  (1,0,2)
Your guess 3:  ["A1","F1","G2"]
My answer:  (1,0,2)
Your guess 4:  ["B1","D1","G2"]
My answer:  (3,0,0)
You got it in 4 guesses!
</pre><!--TOC section id="sec3" Assessment-->
<h2 id="sec3" class="section">Assessment</h2><!--SEC END --><p>Your project will be assessed on the following criteria:</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
70% Quality and correctness of your implementation;
</li><li class="li-itemize">30% Quality of your code and documentation
</li></ul><p>The correctness of your implementation will be assessed
based on whether it succeeds in guessing the targets it is given in
the available time.
Quality will be assessed based on the number of guesses needed to
find the given targets.
Full marks will be given for an average of 4.3 guesses per target,
with marks falling on a logarithmic scale as the number of guesses
rises.
Thus moving from taking 5 guesses to 4 will gain similar number of
points as going
from 7 to 5 guesses. Therefore as the number of guesses drops,
further small decreases in the number of guesses are increasingly
valuable.</p><p>Note that timeouts will be imposed on all tests. You will have at least 5
seconds to guess each target, regardless of how many guesses are needed.
Executions taking longer than that may be unceremoniously terminated,
leading to that test being assessed as failing. Your programs will be
compiled with <span style="font-family:monospace">GHC -O2</span> before testing, so 5 seconds per test
is a very reasonable limit.</p><p>See the Project Coding Guidelines on the LMS for detailed suggestions
for coding style. These guidelines will form the basis of the
quality assessment of your code and documentation.</p><!--TOC section id="sec4" Submission-->
<h2 id="sec4" class="section">Submission</h2><!--SEC END --><p>You must submit your project from the student unix server
<span style="font-family:monospace">dimefox.eng.unimelb.edu.au</span> or
<span style="font-family:monospace">nutmeg.eng.unimelb.edu.au</span>.
Make sure the version of your program source files
you wish to submit is on this server, then <span style="font-family:monospace">cd</span> to the directory
holding your source code and issue the command:
</p><pre>
  submit COMP90048 proj1 Proj1.hs
</pre><p>
(substitute <span style="font-family:monospace">Proj1.lhs</span> if you use literate Haskell).
If your code spans multiple source files, add the extra ones to the
end of that command line.</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold">Important:</span> you must wait a minute or two (or more if the
servers are busy) after submitting, and then issue the command
</p><pre>
    verify COMP90048 proj1 | less
</pre><p>
This
will show you the test results from your submission, as well as the
file(s) you submitted. If the test results show any problems, correct
them and submit again. You may submit as often as you like; only your
final submission will be assessed.</p><p>If you wish to (re-)submit after the project deadline, you may do so
by adding &#X201C;<span style="font-family:monospace">.late</span>&#X201D; to the end of the project name
(<em>i.e.,</em> <span style="font-family:monospace">proj1.late</span>) in the <span style="font-family:monospace">submit</span> and
<span style="font-family:monospace">verify</span> commands. But note that a penalty, described below,
will apply to late submissions, so you should weigh the points you
will lose for a late submission against the points you expect to gain
by revising your program and submitting again.</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold">It is your responsibility to verify your submission.</span></p><p>Windows users should see the LMS Resources list for instructions for
downloading the (free) Putty and Winscp programs to allow you to use
and copy files to the department servers from windows computers. Mac
OS X and Linux users can use the <span style="font-family:monospace">ssh</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">scp</span>, and <span style="font-family:monospace">sftp</span>
programs that come with your operating system.</p><!--TOC subsection id="sec5" Late Penalties-->
<h3 id="sec5" class="subsection">Late Penalties</h3><!--SEC END --><p>
Late submissions will incur a penalty of 0.5% of the possible value of that
submission per hour 
late, including evening and weekend hours.
Late submissions will incur a penalty of 0.5% per hour late,
including evening and weekend hours. This means that a perfect
project that is much more than 4 days late will receive less than half
the marks for the project. If you have a
medical or similar compelling reason for being late, you should contact 
the lecturer
as early as possible to ask for an extension
(preferably before the due date).</p><!--TOC section id="sec6" Hints-->
<h2 id="sec6" class="section">Hints</h2><!--SEC END --><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate">
A very simple approach to this program is to simply guess every
possible combination of pitches until you guess right. There are
only 1330 possible targets, so on average it should only take about
665 guesses, making it perfectly feasible to do in 5 seconds.
However, this will give a very poor score for guess quality.</li><li class="li-enumerate">A better approach would be to only make guesses that are
consistent with the answers you have received for previous guesses.
You can do this by computing the list of possible targets, and
removing elements that are inconsistent with any answers you have
received to previous guesses. A possible target is inconsistent
with an answer you have received for a previous guess if the answer
you would receive for that guess and that (possible) target is
different from the answer you actually received for that guess.<p>You can use your <span style="font-family:monospace">GameState</span> type to store your previous
guesses and the corresponding answers. Or, more efficient and just
as easy, store the list of remaining possible targets in your
<span style="font-family:monospace">GameState</span>, and pare it down each time you receive
feedback for a guess.</p></li><li class="li-enumerate">The best results can be had by carefully choosing each guess so
that it is most likely to leave a small remaining list of possible targets.
You can do this by computing for each remaining possible target the
maximum number of possible targets it will leave if you guess it.
This you can do by computing, for each remaining possible target,
the answer you will receive if it is the actual target, and then
compute how many of the remaining possible targets would yield the
same output, and take the maximum of all of these. Alternatively,
you can take a more probabilistic approach, and compute the
<em>average</em> number of possible targets that will remain after
each guess, giving the <em>expected</em> number of remaining possible
targets for each guess, and choose the guess with the smallest
expected number of remaining possible targets.</li><li class="li-enumerate">Unfortunately, this is much more expensive to compute, and you
will need to be careful to make it efficient enough to use.
One thing you can do to speed
it up is to laboriously (somehow) find the best first guess and hard
code that into your program. After the first guess, there are much
fewer possible targets remaining, and your implementation may be
fast enough then.</li><li class="li-enumerate">You can also remove <em>symmetry</em> in the problem space.
The key insight needed for this is that given any <em>guess</em> and
an answer returned for it, the set of remaining possibilities after
receiving that answer for that guess will
be the same regardless of which target yielded that answer.
This suggests collecting all the <em>distinct</em> answers for a
given guess and for each answer, counting the number of targets that would
give that answer. Since there are much fewer answers than possible targets,
this can save significant work.<p>For example, suppose there are ten remaining candidate targets, and one
guess gives the answer (3,0,0), three others give (1,0,2), and the
remaining six give the answer (2,0,1).
In this case, if you make that guess, there is a 1 in 10 chance of that
being the right answer (so you are left with that as the only remaining
candidate), 3 in 10 of being left with three candidates, and a 6 in 10 chance of being left with six candidates.
This means on average you would expect this answer to leave you with

remaining candidates.
You just need to select a guess that gives the minimum expected number
of remaining candidates.</p><p>Also note that if you do this incorrectly, the worst consequence is
that your program takes more guesses than necessary to find the
target. As long as you only ever guess a possible target,
every guess other than the right one removes at least one possible target,
so you will eventually guess the right target.</p></li><li class="li-enumerate">Note that these are just hints; you are welcome to use any
approach you like to solve this, as long as it is correct and runs
within the allowed time.</li></ol><!--TOC section id="sec7" Note Well:-->
